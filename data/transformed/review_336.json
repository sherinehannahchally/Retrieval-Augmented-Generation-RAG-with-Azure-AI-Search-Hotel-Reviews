  "review_text": "Bad: The parking garage was farther than we thought, was inconvenient but realize its a city and parking is always difficult. I would of liked valet service and would of paid more happily for it. Good: Yes it's small put clearly stated and really set up well. Was very fresh and updated not to mention clean. Would defiantly stay here again on our next visit. The staff in the evening was very efficient and helpful.",
