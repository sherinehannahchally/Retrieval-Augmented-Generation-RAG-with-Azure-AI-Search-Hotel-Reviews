  "review_text": "Bad: Bed bugs. Room too small. Too expensive When I was going to sleep, I found some bed bugs in my bed. It's terrible! I went to lobby to find someone help me. The receptionist helped me change a room. This room is even smaller than the previous one. I can't sleep all the night because it's too noisy, and I am still afraid of the bugs. The next day, I told the receptionist I would like to check out, even I booked for 3 night. She agreed, but didn't give me any compensation. I paid 300+ for a room which had bugs and was noisy, small. Good: The attitude of staff.",
