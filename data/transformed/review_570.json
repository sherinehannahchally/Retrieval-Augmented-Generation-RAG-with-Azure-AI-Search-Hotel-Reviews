  "review_text": "Bad: The hotel is very outdated. Old rooms (we were moved because of an old airco that made a lot of noise), old elevators, tiny beds that should not be sold as double unless you like sleeping on top of each other, mediocre breakfast with very little healthy options (mind you, a 7 extra charge for a cappuccino is outrageous). Very basic pool area. All in all we would give this hotel a good 3 stars. Not more. Good: Location is ok.",
