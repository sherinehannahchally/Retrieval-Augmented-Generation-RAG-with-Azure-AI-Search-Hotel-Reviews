  "review_text": "Bad: There were a couple younger staff at the desk during mid day times that seemed bothered by questions. Good: Easy to park. The room was clean and cool. Valet staff was really nice. Steve the maintence man was amazing. I dropped my pearl earring down the bathroom sink. He took the time to take the loop of the drain and get my pearl earring back. I was grateful for his extra service and care.",
