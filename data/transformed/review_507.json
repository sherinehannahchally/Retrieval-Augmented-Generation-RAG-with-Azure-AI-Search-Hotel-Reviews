  "review_text": "Bad: The staff were not professional. The reception staff who helped me checking in was dressed like being at home. She looked very tired and communicated with me without any expression on her face. My bathroom was a disaster. It became a swimming pool after I used it each time. BTW, the real swimming pool was closed for the seasonal reason. Good: The staff were helpful. The bed is comfortable. The location is just in the very center of the main tourism avenue.",
