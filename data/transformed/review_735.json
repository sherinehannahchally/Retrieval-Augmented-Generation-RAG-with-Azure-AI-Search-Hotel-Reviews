  "review_text": "My wife and I stayed at the St Regis for 8 nights in June 2018 as part pleasure part business trip. This was our second time at the hotel and we cannot fault it. The staff were exceptional and made our stay very memorable. The hotel's location made it great to get around the City and the friendliness of the staff made our time there very enjoyable. Janelle in the fitness centre was a particular favourite of ours as she made going to the gym in the mornings a very welcoming and friendly experience. We will definitely stay here upon our return to New York CityDear GK1708,Thank you very much for taking the time to review your recent stay at The St. Regis New York. We are very pleased to hear how much you enjoyed your stay, and especially your experience in the Athletic Club. We will share your kind comments with Janelle and the team, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.Kindest Regards,Senih GerayGeneral Manager",
