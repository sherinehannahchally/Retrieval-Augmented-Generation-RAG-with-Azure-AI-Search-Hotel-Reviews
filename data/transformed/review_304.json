Good: Great neighborhood on Boylston and a block from Newbury St. Plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance to choose from. It is one of the better values compared to other hotels in Boston. Half a block from the Copley T station if you want to get to another part of the city. 15- 20 minute walk to Fenway Park for the Sox game.",
