  "review_text": "Bad: As others have commented the Valet Parking at 35 per day is steep however it is known before you sign up to it, there is a parking lot close by that only charges 15 per day although not sure what they would charge if you wanted to leave overnight. Good: Very good location on Ocean Drive but away from the noise of the main area. Breakfast was ideal, plenty of choice and had the added bonus available until noon Rooms were clean and tidy and we did not find them small and we had two large suitcases in each as well as other hand luggage. Staff always acknowledged you",
