  "review_text": "Bad: I guess the lack of facilities in the modern world. No pool, hot tub, gym. We got lost a few times walking down stairs, even went into their staff lounge and kitchen by accident. No free wifi anywhere! 10 a day per device.... Good: We loved being in the center of action and its great value. All the staff were very helpful.",
