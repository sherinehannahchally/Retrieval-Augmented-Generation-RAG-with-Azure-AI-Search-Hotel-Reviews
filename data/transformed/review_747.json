  "review_text": "Our son made the arrangement for us to stay here for one night after a short staying in another SPG hotel. We were not too sure whether it would be worth the move for an one night stay! My husband was just recently out of the hospital, and still uses a walker. We thought of the problems with the holiday traffic on the Fifth Ave, getting in and out of the car, and walk up the steps/stairs.....In stead of walking up the steps, we used the elevator located inside the King Cole Bar and Salon next door. Once we stepped into the lobby of St. Rigis, our worries went off the chimney! There seemed to be a special flowery cent in the air as you walked on the shiniest marble designed floors of the hotel. We sat comfortably awaiting for the checking-in. Due to the upgrade to a room with two doubles, we had to wait for a while which was perfectly fine. After a short wait, we were thoughtfully offered to wait in another room to rest until our room was ready. The idea that the management would do that for us has won us over!St. Regis is an one of a kind classy hotel with the old world class charm and beauty. Once inside the room, we were impressed with the modern update using the computer technology, among them: the TV screen fit right into the bathroom mirror would earn a wow factor the 4 types of lightening controls located both near the bed and the entrance of the room was a plus in convenience and lacquer-like Chinese cabinet under the TV to hind the refrigerator and bar was a combo of beauty and convenience. The huge multi-plated mirrors which occupied the entire wall, and the crystals hanging on the chandelier were practically spotless, so were the intricate moldings around the ceiling and the chandelier. The decoration of the room has a luxury feel yet they are just as practical and comfortable as solid every day furniture. The shower which is a separate unit has great water pressure. The tub equipped with the hang-over rack was a perfect way for a relax soak after long walks at the Macy's parade. The marble/stone bath room is spacious and modern which again is a pleasant surprise found in an old hotel. Among those who came to stay and walked those hallways beyond the glass entrance doors on each floor were Eva Gardiner and Salvador Dali, so we were told when first were lead into our room. I must say that we felt just as welcome as any entertainers and/or artists when we were greeted by the staff. As we walked out of the room, as we got in or out of the car, we were greeted politely and warmly. People who stay here for a day or a week are lucky to enjoy the world class luxury, and those who are associated with this first rate elegant hotel appear to be happy and proud to be part of this perfect corporation.Dear goplace42, We are humbled by your complimentary review of your recent stay at our hotel. Thank you for allowing us to provide you with superior and thoughtful service and most importantly, we thank you for making us your new favorite hotel.Sincerely, Octavia Marginean",
