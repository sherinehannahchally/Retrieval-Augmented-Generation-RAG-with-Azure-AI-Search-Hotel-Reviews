  "review_text": "Bad: The prices of the SPA treatment are quite expensive. If you go to most expensive SPA in Dubai the treatment can varies between USD 120 for normal facial cleansing up to USD 500 or 600 for a full package of 4 hours . Yet here the minimum starts at USD 280/- excluding the taxes ! . Good: What not to like about this property !!! Everything was great. The location, the spacious rooms the view the room service the in room dining the restaurants even the Spa. Ok I didn't try the spa due to my busy schedule but it looked so good (although the prices of the treatments were quite expensive). Some people thing that the hotel is a bit expensive, well it is located in one of the most prestigious and expensive districts in LA. It is just located on the famous Rodeo Drive. The rooms were big. I advise you to not take the room with balconies if you know your self won't use it. The balcony takes space out of the room. My most concerns and worries normally in any hotel is the cleanness of the bathroom and toilets and here it was just perfect.",
