  "review_text": "Bad: The parking garage is so hard to find. I passed it at least two times trying to find it. You also can't self park, which is a hassle coming back from being out and about. You have to rush to gather all of your belongings, souvenirs, etc, because the entry bay to the garage will hold two cars at most. You can't dilly dally. Hope that makes sense. Only paid WiFi,which was a big bummer. The express snack bar/grill staff were very unfriendly. Every time I went to the buffet, the line to be seated was always sooo long. I never did end up eating there for that reason. Good: Near all of the Fremont Street Experience stuff.",
