  "review_text": "Bad: I had to be switched because these people next door were partying all hours of the night. At 3am they decided to start arguing in the hall. I called security once for them to turn up their music right after they left. Then security came up again while they were in the hall screaming. I will say this the hotel made it right. They gave me that night free and switched me rooms. Good: The rooms were beautiful. Comfy beds good breakfast.",
