  "review_text": "Bad: We were on the 9th floor and slept really well but could hear the metro. Earplugs are supplied which were useful to my husband. There were two tvs in our one bedroom suite but only one remote control - odd when we wanted to watch two different shows. Good: Absolutely perfect location in Chicago, within one block of the metro, walking distance to most of the top areas to visit and very good restaurants. Very comfortable room and bed, neat layout for the closet and vanity, wonderful shower, cool design features (Vespa chair, red fridge, furniture).",
