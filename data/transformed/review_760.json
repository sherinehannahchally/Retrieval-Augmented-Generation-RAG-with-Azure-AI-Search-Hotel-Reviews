  "review_text": "Attention to detail was incredible at one of New York City's finest hotels.Our suite was beautiful, and despite being worried about traffic noise, we were surprised to have had a very restful night. We used travel points to book our room, and were very impressed to have been upgraded to a better room - this is excellent service and excellent recognition that people who travel all the time rarely cash in their points, but when they do ... it leaves a lasting impression and a very much increased likelihood that we will return and also highly recommend.Well done!Dear SuenearBoston, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",
