Out of hotel stays in 29 countries, hotel W made the top of the list in poor customer relations, poor cleanliness, and horrible problem resolution. First they gave me an occupied room, then they down graded me to a lower grade room over night. The next day they didn't even clean our room when we returned, and they gave away the original room they were hold for me. The suites bathroom smelled like urine so bad and when we complained, it still was not cleaned by that evening. I had to fight with the hotel to apply a discount rate they never even offered. They have a slogan what ever when ever I can't say they once lived by that motto. This is not my first time at the W hotel organization but it certainly will be my last! Deplorable customer experience and engagement.",
