  "review_text": "The bath tub was rusty..literally, mildew along the edge, and small. The bed was very hard and uncomfortable. The Free 14.95 breakfast was terrible, couldn't drink the coffee it was so bitter and nothing hot was offered. The room ended up being 100 more than advertised after all the taxes and what was supposed to be free breakfast... Location",
