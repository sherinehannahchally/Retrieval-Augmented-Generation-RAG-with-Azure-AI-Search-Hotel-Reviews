  "review_text": "Bad: Not a fan of cigarette smoke. But I guess you can't do anything about it in the gambling area. Silly to charge a resort fee on top of the room charge. Just charge what you need for the room. Good: Very helpful and friendly staff from check in to the valets.",
  "review_title": "Good value near the strip.",
