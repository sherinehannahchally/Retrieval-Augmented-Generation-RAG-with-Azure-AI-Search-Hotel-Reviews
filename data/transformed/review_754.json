  "review_text": "Welcome to one of the most iconic and beautiful hotels of Manhattan! Marble, crystals, golden leaf paintings, elegantly decorated rooms combining newest technology and extreme comfort in a charming style that one may find somehow a little bit Marie Antoinette. Kind staff, great Doorman from Bretagne, Champagne sabotage at the Bar. Maybe some room for improvement on the side of the kitchen to refine the bar menu and breakfast. A wonderful home feel. Congrats and Thank you! Dear jfcollobert,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel.
