  "review_text": "Bad: A very minor quibble: only one side of the bed had a nightstand. Good: Room design was well thought out and executed, making an average-sized space especially user-friendly for a couple. Also, the room had more power outlets than I've ever seen in a hotel room. Staff was helpful and friendly, second-floor bar was very nice.",
