  "review_text": "Bad: The only draw back is the noise at night from th people coming in and out of the lounge and adjacent nightclub. Though it didn't bother us personally. Good: I loved how central the location was. The hotel is in the theatre district. We walked to the harbour as well as Shopping and all the parks around us. After a long day of walking around we enjoyed A massage at the Bliss spa. We also enjoyed having a drink at the lounge before going to bed. It was a great experience for us. It might be too noisy for people who want peace and quite. I also had the best sleep in those beds. I would recommend staying at the W Boston.",
