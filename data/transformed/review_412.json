  "review_text": "Bad: Only down side was the breakfast as hot choices were always overcooked splitting hairs as a coffee drinker would say coffee was awful. But you have perfectly good diner 2 block away so no big deal. Good: Location, rooms, front Terrace and great staff plus the hotel was super clean and well presented. Will definitely be back. Not forgetting beach towels provided and sun loungers on the beach.",
