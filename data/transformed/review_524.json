  "review_text": "Bad: 1. You have to walk through the casino to the rooms-- This is irritating. 2. Water took soooo long to get to the 15th floor. Waste of water to run it 7minutes to get it hot. 3. Very costly..... Especially for it's location and to the convention center. Simply outrageous for the value. Good: 1. Staff was great. 2. Room was clean 3. Decor was lovely. 4. Food was great.",
