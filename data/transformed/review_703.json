  "review_text": "Bad: The doormen could have reacted a bit quicker to open the inner doors, which were very heavy. They sprang into action for the outer doors, but saw a dad with buggy struggle to get through, and people with cases, let in through the outside door, and having to open the inner door themselves with luggage. Good: The welcome was great. Staff were helpful and interested. The room was stylish and spacious, with great facilities in the room like iPod Dock.",
