  "review_text": "Bad: The check-in process was not good. I felt that I had been singled out as a young black male for staying at this hotel. Later, I also saw a young black male in the same situation as myself. In addition, every 45 minutes from 7:30 am - 11:45, I had housekeeping knock on the door twice, and two people walked in while my girlfriend and I were naked. Horrible experience. I called the next day to speak with the manager, left voice mails, and still no response!. Good: The majority of the staff was great.",
