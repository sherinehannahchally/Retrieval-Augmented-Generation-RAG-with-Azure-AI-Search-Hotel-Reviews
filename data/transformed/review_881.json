  "review_text": "Bad: What I didnt like is the service of the staff. I reserved and paid last October a city view room, check in online on our way to the hotel and was assured key is waiting. But when we got there, no room available for city view. We were settled for a night in 3rd floor and we were assured the next 5nights we will be in the 6th floor. But the following day, they gave us a floor higher only, 4th floor. We cant see much of the city from 4th floor. All we can see is adjacent buildings. We were frustrated that there is no cafeteria for breakfast. Yeah, breakfast is included on the price but no chair to sit on, no table use. It is a grab and go breakfast. Very incovenient because breakfast is served in 5th and 6th floors's console table only. No microwave, no toaster. How can you eat the bagels they served in very cold temperature Secondly, we were not given instructions / info on our check in at the hotel what are the facilities they have for us. We only discovered while we were staying at the hotel. Like business center, fitness center,etc. The housekeeping, bad service! They forgot to replace the complimentary k-cup coffee. One day, they left a used pair of socks in our room. A pair of black socks rolled,dirty for a man whose size could be for a 6 footer and taller. My boys are only 5'3. Next day, they left again a wet soiled pink shirt on the table where the TV is. Why is that Everyday I always left as tip and a way of thank you for cleaning the room but all they leave is mess. Good: I like the location of this hotel. Very accessible to everything,from all kinds of food/resto to tourist attractions.",
