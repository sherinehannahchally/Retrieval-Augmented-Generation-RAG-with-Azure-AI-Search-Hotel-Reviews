  "review_text": "Bad: There is no longer a casino on the hotel grounds which is unfortunate. Also, the pool is a bit small. You have to battle to find a spot with the lounge chairs at times. Good: The rooms were clean and staff was nice. The parking is free and it is about 1 1/2 blocks from the strip. It is on the north side of the Bally's.",
