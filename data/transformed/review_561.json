  "review_text": "Bad: I will write in English so the staff can read if they wish: we arrived exactly at 4 PM (declared check in time), the room was not ready, the reason being 20 people having done an early check in, please notice that check out time is 11 AM (so they clearly have a workforce planning problem)! An extremely unfriendly staff representative told us that we had to wait, asked me to give her my phone number so that I can receive a text message when the room would be ready, meanwhile we were granted a pass for the pool (which was no extra given that the pool was available for all hotel guests as we were). I asked according to your experience, how long will it take 20 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours her answer was rude and dismissive I don't know, the only thing I can tell you is to wait for the text message. At that time your room will be available!. So we went to the pool (definitely small and overcrowded), no seats available, very noisy. We waited, and waited and waited and waited... 2 hours and 20 minutes, then I went back to the lobby extremely upset, I started complaining and magically the room was ready... By the way: the text message never arrived. Good: Free parking (is this something to be appreciated)",
