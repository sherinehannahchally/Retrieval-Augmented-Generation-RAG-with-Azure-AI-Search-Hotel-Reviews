  "review_text": "Bad: At breakfast the waiter gave you a receipt stating that although the breakfast was free (included in the price of B B) it was worth 49.98, ie they were after a tip. I felt this was unnecessary and made guests feel uncomfortable. The breakfast was self service, the waiters just brought tea and coffee. Good: This hotel was lovely, very clean, good breakfast and friendly staff. Good situation,about 5 minutes walk to The Strip.",
