Good: The hotel staff was incredibly attentive and sent us a bottle or Prosseco and chocolate covered strawberries to help celebrate our anniversary. It was such a welcome surprise that really made our stay special. We also appreciated the drink tokens and lounge area with appetizers- made it very comfortable to stay there!",
