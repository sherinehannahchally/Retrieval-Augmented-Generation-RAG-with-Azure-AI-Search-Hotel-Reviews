  "review_text": "Bad: Can be a little noisy at night but that is the compromise for being at the centre of all the action. Good: If you are looking to be at the centre of all the South Beach madness then this is the perfect hotel. Located right across from the beautiful beach and in the middle of the Art Deco district. Large comfortable rooms that offer full amenities. Good rooftop pool with great snack and drinks bar. Staff very helpful and John the concierge was great.",
