  "review_text": "Bad: I can't think of anything. Good: The hotel was less than 1/2 mile to the strip (an easy 10 minute walk), which allowed me to be close enough to take advantage of it, but far enough removed to get away from the mega-ness of it. Check-in was easy, the staff was friendly and helpful, the size of the room was pretty standard (which is all I wanted or needed), the bathroom was clean and well-appointed, and the bed was comfortable.",
