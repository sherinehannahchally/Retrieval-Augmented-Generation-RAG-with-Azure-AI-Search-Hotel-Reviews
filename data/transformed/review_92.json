  "review_text": "Bad: A little sticker shock with 65/night valet parking, but I hadn't done my research for cheaper options, so not a big deal. Good: Super hip and definitely a young techy vibe, but everyone was friendly and helpful. Room was as described and very spacious for the location and price. Even though it is right at the corner of the L Tracks, sound wasn't a problem. Exactly what was needed!",
