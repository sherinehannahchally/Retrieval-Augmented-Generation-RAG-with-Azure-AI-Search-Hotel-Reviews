  "review_text": "Bad: The elevator was tricky to use as you had to insert your room key which didn't always work. The front desk never mentioned it either so I had to figure it out on my own. Good: The location was great. The room was basic but still nice and clean. The pool was low key, perfect for relaxing.",
  "review_title": "After the hustle and bustle of the strip, it was nice to walk into The Westin.",
