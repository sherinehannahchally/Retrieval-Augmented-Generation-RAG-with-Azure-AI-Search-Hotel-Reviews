  "review_text": "Bad: The wait to enter the buffet was too long never got in the whole week.. When I went to the other restaraunt I was told I couldn't order certain items as they are for happy hour only so I left. They also did not have a pool or any alternative except travel 18 miles to their other facility and use their pool. They never even gave me a discount for lack of this facitilityor even notifying me as I made my reservation months in advance, I also did not like having to park outside of the parking garage only cause I was riding a motorcycle the parking garage was for cars only. I felt as though I was a second class citizen, no laundry facility service or machines . Good: The location was good and the staff especially the cleaning of my room was great.",
