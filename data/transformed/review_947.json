  "review_text": "Bad: Used my credit card to hold reservation but was going to pay cash. When I checked out they said they already processed my credit card and would not refund it and l could not pay cash. I am from Canada and have a US bank account so when the Can and US dollars were at par I put my travel money into it. By paying with my credit card, I ended up paying an extra 150 in exchange rate and user fees. They also charged my credit card the day I booked- which I didn't know until my statement came in. Good: beds were very comfortable. breakfast in hallway every morning very convenient. location was good-very close to river and a couple of blocks from metro stations. Staff very friendly.",
