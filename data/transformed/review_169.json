  "review_text": "Bad: To be honest, nothing to complain about. Just too bad that there wasn't any free wifi in the rooms. Good: Considering that we only paid 88 dollars for 2 persons for 2 nights, this was great value for money. The hotel is located in the middle of Fremont Street, so you just step outside and you are in the middle of the action. Our room was on the 9th floor and we didn't hear any noise whatsoever. The room was maybe a bit old fashioned, but still offered everything you need. We were positively surprised that we had access to the pool and gym of the California hotel. We just needed to walk 2 mins to access their facilities. The gym was really good equipped for a hotel gym. Pool was really nice and quiet. Would definitely stay here again!",
