  "review_text": "I loved this hotel. It captures a distinctive golden age vibe in a very special way. On check-in, there was a small disturbance in the lobby due to the behaviour of another guest who was unhappy with her allocated room. The only blip during our stay was that the room we were allocated with an external view was clearly given to this complaining guest. The manager literally took the key from the hands of the lady checking us in as she was giving them to me (and after we had been told what a lovely room we had been allocated)... But the hotel was professional enough to deal with our concern immediately, and we were given a gorgeous external view room facing onto Fifth Avenue and complimentary breakfast and drinks. This rapid commitment to service was indicative of the rest of our stay. Otherwise, the whole stay was perfect. The room was elegant. It felt very classic and luxurious, but also had any modern convenience. The King Cole bar was the perfect place to meet friends. The complimentary Bentley was a special touch to drop us to dinner at a perfect concierge recommendation. We loved the atmosphere in the hotel restaurant the next morning for breakfast. I would stay here again without hesitation. We felt valued and special.Dear johntillett, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.
