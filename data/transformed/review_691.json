  "review_text": "Bad: There was an anti-noise device plugged into each of two sockets to compensate for the fact they are in a noisy road. In fact, this emits itself a loud roaring sound. When unplugged, things were fine. The road noise was not bad at all (we were on the 12th floor). One of the senior staff kindly refunded a breakfast bill given this and another issue (cordless phone by the bed wouldn't stop beeping through the night). The restaurant and room service were extremely expensive. There was a slight sense too that some of the decor (wood-appearance veneer on cabinets, shower curtain not panel ) was a bit cheap and scuffed given the price. Good: Staff were great - thoughtful, friendly and clearly dedicated to running it well.Decor and atmosphere of front lounge area welcoming and stylish. Location is very good.",
