  "review_text": "Bad: Problems with door lock led to no response from maintenance and even after security got us in, they failed to fix the lock (had to be recoded) despite assuring us they fixed it. So we got locked out again the next morning. Cost us 2 frustrating hours. Good: Location is good for business, quiet but close to everything.",
