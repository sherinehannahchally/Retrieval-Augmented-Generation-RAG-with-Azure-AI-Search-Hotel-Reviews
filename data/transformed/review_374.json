Pool under repair--sent to another hotel--no available chairs at the pool - so no pool on a 95 day. Wasted 3 hours of the day. 3. Told there was a 30 minute wait to get a car from valet--called at 7:20 AM--valet was not told to get the car until 7:53 AM. Almost missed plane. Good: management staff was very good when they were there",
