  "review_text": "Bad: Me and my husband came to Chicago for our 10 year wedding aniversary. My 10 year anyversary gift from my husband,a watch, was STOLEN from our room while it was being cleaned the day before we left Chicago.The head housekeeper claimd she talked to the person that cleaned our room,but said they didnt see any watch and told me I must have misplaced it, putting the robery on me!!We turned the room up side down,but of course there was NO WATCH!!Nobody offered to call the police,but we were told we could GO TO THE police station and file the paperwork.For two tourists in a country they have never been to before just a few days after the shooting that killed captain Paul Bauer, we didnt even know how to begin to talk to the police.We didnt get any compensation,but the head housekeeper offered us a drink at the bar..... finding out when we came back home that we were charged for the drink. Good: The front desk people were very helpful and nice - especially Emily Mendoza.",
