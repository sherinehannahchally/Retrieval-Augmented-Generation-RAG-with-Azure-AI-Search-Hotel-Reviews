Nice looking spot, so I kinda look like a bum when I travel so not to attract crime or Theves . And I usually travel around walking and exploring so I travel light aka bum looking ... the staff was very friendly to me . The room was awesome nice touches classical music playing after a shower and some music I was rejuvenated and went to the bar an had great conversation really a good memory to my trip I'd defiantly stay here again like the small hotel appeal . Great stay .",
