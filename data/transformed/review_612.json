  "review_text": "Bad: The fact that the Casino was being renovated and not in use, and that we weren't notified about this prior to arrival. An extra tax being applied to our charges. To call this establishment a resort is simply untrue. No laundry facilities available. No exhaust fan in bathroom. A limit as to how cool the air-con could be set. Good: The size and set-up of our room was very good. The location in regards to the stripwas approx 500 metres away.",
