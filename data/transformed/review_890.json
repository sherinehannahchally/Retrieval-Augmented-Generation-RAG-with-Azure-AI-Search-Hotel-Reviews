  "review_text": "The reception desk guy at checkin was reckless. The breakfast is extremely poor (some apples, cakes and coffee) uncomfortably served in every corridor of each floor of the hotel. Comfort is absent, there is no soundproofing in the rooms facing the street, nor in the back. The use of ear plugs is mandatory and probably insufficient to reduce continuous noise (day and night) from heavy duty air conditioning equipment of many commercial buildings surrounding the hotel. The Hotel offers extremely poor value for money. It is not a four (4) stars at all. Staying there was hard and exhausting. AVOID IT. Suitable cleanliness and location.",
