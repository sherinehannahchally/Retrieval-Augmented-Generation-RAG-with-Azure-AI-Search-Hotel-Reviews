  "review_text": "Bad: Provided breakfast is just bagels and doughnuts + tea/coffee. I'm not sure how that qualifies as continental! Beds are very small but OK for a relatively small couple - would be uncomfortable if you are much over 6 feet. Rooms are small but that's the only way you are getting a room at this price in this location. Good: Location is excellent (we walked everywhere including from Boston Back Bay station to the hotel with our bags - it's a 10min walk), staff were friendly, rooms are small but reasonably well appointed, hotel and rooms were very clean.",
