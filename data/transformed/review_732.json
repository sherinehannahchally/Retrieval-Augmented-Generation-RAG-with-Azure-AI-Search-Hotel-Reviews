  "review_text": "We hadn't stayed at the St. Regis for many years. We decided to try it again for a 2 night stay to celebrate our anniversary. We were upgraded to a larger suite than we had reserved. It was a beautifully appointed room with all the modern amenities. It was a smart room that had all the controls for the lighting and draperies from either room.We had a beautiful view of 5th avenue from our living room. The room came with butler service which was a great amenity.The best part of the St. Regis besides the wonderful rooms is definitely the location. You step out of the hotel and you're in the middle of a shopper's paradise. Every designer store is at your doorstep. So if you want to shop till you drop it's a great location. You're also steps away from Central Park and all the wonderful museums we have in New York City.The St. Regis has it all, great service, beautiful rooms and a perfect location. Looking to return soon to enjoy being in the city!Dear MissS85, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your special occasion. Happy Anniversary and many more happy years to come!On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",
