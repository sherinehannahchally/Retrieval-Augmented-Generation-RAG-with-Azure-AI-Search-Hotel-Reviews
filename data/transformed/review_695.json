  "review_text": "Bad: The only negative was some mysterious in-room snack bar charges that appeared on my bill after I left. I contacted the hotel, and they promptly removed them. This has happened to me at other Starwood properties before, and I'm not sure why. Good: The hotel is in a great location and is clean/modern with a courteous staff. The room I was in was spacious and quiet, and had everything I needed.",
