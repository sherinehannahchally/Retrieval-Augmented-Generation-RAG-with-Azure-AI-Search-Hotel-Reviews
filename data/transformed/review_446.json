  "review_text": "Bad: quite a bit of noise from the upstairs 'neighbors.' They could do better with soundproofing... also, the breakfast was a bit weak. Eggs overcooked, somewhat tasteless and kind of cold, no specialty coffee drinks available and not much for healthy options. if you have a car, beware that for all intents and purposes the valet parking is required, and will run an extra 35/night. Good: lovely decor, super friendly and helpful bilingual staff. Bed was comfortable and the shower was good.",
