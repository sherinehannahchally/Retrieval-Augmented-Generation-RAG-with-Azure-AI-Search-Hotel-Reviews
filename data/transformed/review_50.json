  "review_text": "The hotel is located near all the attractions on the Harbor. We were provided more than we expected. There was parking right across the street restaurants within 5 minute walking distance and most of all hot and cold continental breakfast in the morning and hot coffee and tea available all day in the lobby. The rooms were very comfortable. I slept just like I was at home. Oh, I can't forget the staff: they were on their job with an attitude of excellence!",
