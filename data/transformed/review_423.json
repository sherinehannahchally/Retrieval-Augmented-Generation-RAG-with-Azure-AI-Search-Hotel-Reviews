  "review_text": "Bad: There was loud music playing at night and in the morning. Luckily I'm a heavy sleeper so it didn't really bother me. Good: Great location in Miami Beach (south). Close to all the action but off the main stretch so it's more peaceful. Near to lots of shops. There was an issue with our room and we had to spend one night in their sister hotel. The staff couldn't have been more helpful to make sure we were comfortable. The hotel offers a portable wifi hotspot for guests to take out with them - very cool!",
