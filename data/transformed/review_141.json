  "review_text": "Bad: The restaurant was closed for a refurb and as a result we had to eat our breakfast in the lobby on our knees. We had tiny plastic plates and plastic cutlery and a poor food choice . I was not informed by booking.com that this was the case . It was not the service we wanted for 675 dollars for 2 nights!!. Good: The room was good",
