Good: What's there not to like The wonderful staff at the Westin even guessed we were getting married in Vegas and, to our total surprise, when we got back to the hotel after our wedding ceremony, we had a bottle of champagne and chocolate-coated strawberries waiting for us. The hotel's restaurant, the Savona Bistro, simply has the best angus burger in the world! The location, for those of us who prefer to skip the hustle and bustle of the Strip: perfect!",
