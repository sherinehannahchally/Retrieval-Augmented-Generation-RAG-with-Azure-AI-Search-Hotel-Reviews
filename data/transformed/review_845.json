That was very nice, however, having a place to eat outside of our room would be nice. But knowing there isn't anywhere to do that I think you do an excellent job with everything. We will definitely be coming back! Thank you. Good: The room and bathroom were spacious and very nice, very clean and updated. We stayed in the deluxe king room. Staff were all very nice and helpful!",
