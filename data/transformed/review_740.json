  "review_text": "With an air of urban sophistication and a location that can't be beat The St. Regis occupies the corner of 5th and 55th only blocks from Central Park, MOMA and the best retail shopping in America. On a cold winter afternoon loaded with bags displaying the logos of the finest brands guests are greeted at the elevator with a choice of hot apple cider, chocolate or beef broth. Recently remodeled rooms are roomy by NYC standards and fresh and of course the Butler service puts it's over the top. I don't think you can find a better lounge for a casual drink then the King Cole Bar. Don't miss the Bloody Mary menu (a drink that was invented here). An oasis, a grand hotel, a total pleasure.Dear Gene B,Thank you very much for your kind words about our hotel. We are so pleased that you enjoyed your stay in a renovated room and were able to enjoy our holiday hot chocolate offering. We hope you have a wonderful holiday season and we look forward to seeing you again in 2015.Best Regards,Manuel MartinezHotel Manager",
