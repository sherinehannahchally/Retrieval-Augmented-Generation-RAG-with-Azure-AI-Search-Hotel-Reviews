  "review_text": "Bad: Dropped in for advice on a good Japanese restaurant. The concierge seemed perplexed and said he would call or email with info. He never did. In fact there was a great sushi just in front of the hotel. Very strange. When I called the concierge from outside the hotel I was put on hold and left on hold. I could have died on hold. The rooms need a facelift and I have stayed in better for half the price. The restaurant for breakfast is soulless and very expensive and not up to much. Regarding the above you have many comments on TripAdvisor about the same so why not do something about it. Good: Joyce the concierge ( I think that was her name) made up for the others who probably couldn't find Los Angeles on the map. The pool. The location That's it.",
