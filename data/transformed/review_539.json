  "review_text": "Bad: The restaurant was closed for the day when we arrived so we had to go out yo eat and the free happy hour that I'd read about had been discontinued. That was particularly disappointing as that was one of the factors I looked at when choosing a hotel. Also, the view we had was the parking lot, not the city view I expected. Good: The bed was very comfortable, what I'd expect from a Westin.",
