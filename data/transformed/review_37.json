  "review_text": "Excellent experience. Due to a mix-up on my part with the online travel service it was set up as a king rather than two queen beds, for two guys. I immediately called at the time and Hampton said they would make a note that a room with two queens was needed. When i got there, they didn't have a 2-queen room so they put me up in another king room (and my buddy stayed in the original room) at NO additional expense, and I moved to a 2-queen room the next day. That is awesome, customer-oriented service.",
