  "review_text": "Bad: Our toilet overflowed at 1am and the water wouldn't stop. When we tried to call reception the phone didn't work. My husband went down to reception whilst I packed our clothes as I naturally assumed we would be given another room. He returned with a maintenance employee and a housekeeping employee. They refused to give us another room (so we could go back to sleep!) instead keeping us awake until 2am whilst they sorted out the problem, extracted the water from the floor (the bathroom was flooded), mopped the floor and brought fresh towels. Good: The reception staff were very friendly. A bottle of sparkling was sent to our room to celebrate our wedding anniversary upon our arrival. That was a really nice touch.",
