  "review_text": "Bad: Room walls are incredibly thin! Ambient noise from all around! I heard my neighbor sneeze, and I felt horrible coughing at night for fear of disturbing other floors! Parking and walking to the room was long and difficult with many bags. Limited hotel parking with expensive rates. Public parking becomes the only option, and while not as terribly inconvenient as you would think, it would still be nice if Miyako had their own, larger facilities. Good: Amazing location, and very cool bidet feature in the bathrooms. Spacious size rooms in the executive suites for the price value. AC kicks on very fast and cools the room nicely. Great views from floors higher up.",
