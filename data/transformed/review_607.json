  "review_text": "Bad: rooms were in need of updating especially the bathrooms. Toilet was leaky and loud, the TV was dated, and there were updates being performed at the time of stay. Other than than it was worth the money. Good: The proximity was great because it was easy to access and close enough to the strip. They have a great sandwich shop at the shell station on the corner open until 2 am which is a bonus and saved us a ton of on food. Also a little hole in the wall casino bar where you can get a beer and all beef hot dog for 3, shots for 4 just down the street.",
