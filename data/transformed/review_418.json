Good: Very good location, one block from the beach (2 min walk). 3 min to Ocean Drive/Lummus Park, 5 min to Nikki Beach Club. Chairs and umbrellas on the beach from an external provider from 8.30 am to 6.30 pm included. Towels are provided. Valet parking 35 for 24h, no overnight street parking (day 4/h).",
