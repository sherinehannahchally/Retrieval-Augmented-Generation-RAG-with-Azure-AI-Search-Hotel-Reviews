  "review_text": "Bad: There was NOTHING we disliked! The room was small but that was to be expected and the two of us were very comfortable there. The room size and the narrow hallways gave the entire place the European feel... nothing wrong with that, right. Good: 1. Outstanding location! Close to the T, the airport shuttle, historic churches, Public Library (also an attraction in itself), Prudential SkyDeck, the amazing Newbury St. with all the shops and restaurants... I could go on and on. 2. Excellent staff - attentive, helpful, understanding, flexible... overall very pleasant without being over the top. 3. A small place that felt like home, without that big corporate hotel feel. 4. A good continental breakfast that never ran out of any items. 5. Free WiFi that ran very well. 6. Reliable cooling/heating system. 7. All the small details such as nice toiletry items, modern plumbing, detachable shower head, hairdryer, iron, a huge mirror... Thank you, CharlesMark! We hope to stay there again.",
