  "review_text": "Bad: The fan in our room made a ticking sound throughout the night which was annoying. Also, there are not many choices for food. A couple of flat breads are offered for dinner. Breakfast is more reasonable with pastries, bagels, and fruit. Good: The bed was very comfortable. The space in the room was well used. Very clean. I loved the exposed brick throughout the halls, and that actual keys are given out, not key cards. Great location and staff.",
