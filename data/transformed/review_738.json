  "review_text": "This was my second stay at the St Regis NY. The hotel has been revamped is much more expensive bit i can't say it has much improved. On the bright side: got an upgrade and a very nice room, late checkout, the concierges are knowledgeable and get you in difficult places like the Polo Bar across the street.downsides: the Ducasse restaurant is gone and hasn't been replaced so you're left with a somewhat lame breakfast/diner lounge. The King Cole must be run trotskyists since i was refused entry before midnight despite identifying myself as an hotel guest. I duly complained and next day was served a deliberate over spicy bloody mary in what felt like retaliation. The hotel as a butler service that packs your stuff on demand. I lost i cherished Lanvin fedora on the process without so much of an excuse. Considering the price you pay you can find better options in NY. By the way i'm an SPG Gold so the upgrades and late check outs come with the status.Dear Joao C, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York.
