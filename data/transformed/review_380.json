Our ocean view room was wonderful and we are looking forward to staying again once the renovation is completed!The rooms were clean, but need some upgrading--But we were only in the room to sleep so it really didn't bother us...The mini fridge came in handy as well as the ABC Market a few steps away. Subway, Coldstone, Wolfgang Puck's are two minutes away walking...Sushi place within 5 minutes walking!!! McDonald's Burger King within 3 minutes walking...Check out the Pacific Hotel for some awesome cuisine and a huge aquarium!Thanks for making our 4th of July fun....Hey, everyone, don't forget to pick up the Entertainment Book for Hawaii...We saved a lot on Parasailing, Hiking, Snorkeling, Restaurants, Pearl Harbor, etc...Great two for one offers! I got mine on Ebay!",
