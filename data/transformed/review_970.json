So my one negative will be fixed!!. Good: The staff was amazingly friendly! Breakfast was on each guest room floor and got to have breakfast in bed!! Free food and drink in the lounge every night. It was so easy to get around the city. Most of it was within walking distance, but I took the L to Wrigley Field. Super Easy! Free Wifi as well.",
