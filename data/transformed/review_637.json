  "review_text": "Bad: When we arrived we were met by a unfriendly doorman and it was so loud due to the bar that we could barely hear the person at reception. Each day the room was made up apparently but barely even folded the sheets. towels weren't folded etc. We have stayed in lots of hotels over the years and had recently stayed at the Loews Boston which was a far far better experience with far friendlier staff. Good: Food was awesome.",
