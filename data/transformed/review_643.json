  "review_text": "Bad: Rooms felt old. We had a reservation for 4 but not the towels, cups etc for 4. Hair dryer was weak and insufficient. Bathroom counter were way too low and came to my lower thigh. Killed my back. Brushing teeth, shaving etc. Decor was showing its age. Good: Location near the commons was good. There's a small playground nearby which is good for those with youmg kids.",
